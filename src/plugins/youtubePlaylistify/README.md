# Youtube Playlistify

Finds YouTube embeds in a channel, generates a temporary playlist from those videos, and opens it in your default browser. Invoke using by right-clicking on a channel in the sidebar and selecting the context menu option or via the button in the upper right toolbar. This button will only appear if the plugin thinks that there are videos in this channel. Note that the built-in YouTube functionality we're using only supports up to 50 videos, so the playlist can only include at most the 50 most recently posted videos.
