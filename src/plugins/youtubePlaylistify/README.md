# Youtube Playlistify

Finds YouTube embeds in a channel, generates a temporary playlist from those videos, and opens it in your default browser. Invoke using either the `/playlistify` slash command or by right-clicking on a channel in the sidebar and selecting the context menu option.

Note that the built-in YouTube functionality we're using only supports up to 50 videos, so the playlist will only include the 50 most recently posted videos.
